1. The event is triggered by a click of the mouse on any square within the map
2. When the mouse is clicked, the adjacent squares are randomly either turned into Cal Poly logos or remain unaffected. All miners within 3 squares are transformed into Cal Poly students. The man himself, Jeffery Armstrong also appears on the clicked square
3. Cal Poly Students are desperate for that grade, and will seek out and transform one blob into an A+ before returning to a blacksmith and despawning.
4. Jeffery desperately wants to create a better dining experience, so he will spawn Vista Grande Dining Complexes at random locations within two squares of himself in each direction. He will spawn five while moving towards the nearest blacksmith and then despawn.
5. William found the images to be used for Jeff and Vista Grande. He implemented the behavior of Jeffery, and the initial behavior of the Cal Poly Students. He also helped the CP's spawn in randomly within the given radius. Duncan created all of the bmp files which required repainting the miners. He designed the final behavior of the Cal Poly students and the movement behavior of Jeffery. He also created the behavior of Vista Grande.
