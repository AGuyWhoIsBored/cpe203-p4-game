1. The event is triggered by a click of the mouse on any square within the map.
2. When the mouse is clicked, the background of squares within a 3x3 square of the mouse click have a random chance of turning into the all-familiar CP logo.
   All miners within a 7x7 square of the mouse click are transformed into Cal Poly students. The man himself, Jeffery Armstrong (the new entity type), also appears on the clicked square.
3. Cal Poly Students are desperate for that good grade grade. As such, they will seek out and transform one blob into an A+ before returning to a blacksmith and despawning after a hard day of work.
4. Jeffery desperately wants to create a better dining experience to increase the food rating on Niche. 
   To do this, he will spawn Vista Grande Dining Complexes at random locations within three squares of himself in each direction. 
   He will start construction of four dining complexes (spawn in) while moving towards the nearest blacksmith. Once he reaches the blacksmith, he despawns whether he did his job or not as it was a hard day of work for him too.
5. William found the images to be used for Jeff and Vista Grande. He implemented the behavior of Jeffery, and the initial behavior of the Cal Poly Students. He also helped the CP's spawn in randomly within the given radius. 
   Duncan created all of the bmp files which required repainting the miners as well as the A+. He designed the final behavior of the Cal Poly students and the movement behavior of Jeffery. He also created the behavior of Vista Grande.
   Both William and Duncan contributed to this document as well as fixing numerous bugs throughout development.
